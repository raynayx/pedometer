- take data from xl in bites of 50
- store in array of axes
- filter the data into user xl and gravity xl (parser)
- process:
    - dot product to isolate movement in the direction of gravity
    - filter low frequencies from resulting 1D data (low_5_hz)
    - filter high frequencies from previous step(high_1_hz)
- analyze
    - set threshold
    - inititalize steps
